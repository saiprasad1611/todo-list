"Excited to share my latest project, a Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the added functionality of local storage! üìùüíª

With this project, I aimed to create a user-friendly and efficient task management tool. By leveraging HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, I developed a dynamic web application that allows users to add and delete tasks on their to-do list.

One of the key features of this project is the integration of local storage. By utilizing the browser's local storage API, the application is able to store the user's tasks locally. This means that even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page, their tasks remain saved, providing a seamless user experience.

Building this project not only enhanced my skills in front-end development but also taught me the importance of data persistence and improving user experience.
